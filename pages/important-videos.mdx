The title of this page is an in-joke. "Watch this important video" was generally followed by a phone appearing in your face with something definietly not important. I want to take that concept, and spin it back around.

The videos and articles listed below are a collection of the things that I find while on the internet. I want to focus on interesting takes on topic I enjoy, which means that things range from programming, to music, to art, to games, to history, and pretty much anywhere.

Standard disclaimer of "these are not my opinions" and "my thoughts may have changed since I added things here", but obviously these things had enough impact that I wanted to share them somewhere. Not just anywhere, but somewhere more personal.

export const sortedLinks = important.sort(
  (a, b) => new Date(b.dateAdded).getTime() - new Date(a.dateAdded).getTime()
);

<div>
  {sortedLinks.map(link => (
    <div>
      <h3>
        <Link href={link.link}>{link.title}</Link> -{" "}
        <Link href={link.creator.link}>{link.creator.name}</Link>
        <img alt={link.title} src={link.img} nocaption />
      </h3>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
