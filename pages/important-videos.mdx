The title of this page is an in-joke. "Watch this important video" was generally followed by a phone appearing in your face with something definietly not important. I want to take that concept, and spin it back around.

The videos and articles listed below are a collection of the things that I find while on the internet. I want to focus on interesting takes on topic I enjoy, which means that things range from programming, to music, to art, to games, to history, and pretty much anywhere. I also don't want to flood it with the same few people all the time, so I will go out of my way to make this list more varied.

export const sortedLinks = important.sort(
  (a, b) => new Date(b.dateAdded).getTime() - new Date(a.dateAdded).getTime()
);

<div>
  {sortedLinks.map(link => (
    <MediaPreview media={link} key={link.title} />
  ))}
</div>
