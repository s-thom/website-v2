I'm a random person on the internet! I'm currently working as a Software Developer in New Zealand. I went to the [University of Waikato](https://waikato.ac.nz), and graduated with a Bachelor's of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (Hons., First Class). I enjoy writing code, playing music, and walking (over mountains, through forests, around gardens. Anything really).

You'll find a bunch of different projects over at [GitHub](https://github.com/s-thom). Some are even listed below. I welcome contributions to my projects; fork, branch, and make a Pull Request.
