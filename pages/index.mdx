As you might have noticed, these pages have been archived. The reason is that what I want out of this website has changed. I've changed, little by little as time goes on. The few posts that I wrote over the past 4-5 years aren't really the kinds of things I want to have featured front and centre.

I also understand that permanence is a strange thing on the internet. We all expect the things we use to stay forever, or at least long enough, but the reality is that dead links are a common occurrence. As much as I don't want these posts to be visible anymore, I also don't want to be a part of the problem.

So, as a compromise, I'm keeping my old content up for the foreseeable future, just on a different domain to distance it from new things. I hope that's good enough.

Speaking of internet archival, I've decided to [donate to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/) so they can keep preserving our collective digital histories. While my action of shifting my old posts here is a pretty minor action, the work that they do, and make available for free, is invaluable. If you've read this, then I ask you to consider donating a little bit of your own time and/or money to helping the Archive.
