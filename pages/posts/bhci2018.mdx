I presented my Honours work at the 32nd International BCS Human Computer Interaction Conference in July 2018. A big thank you to Annika, Claire, and Nic for putting it together and inviting me to go over to Belfast present it myself.

During the conference I presented a paper largely based off my honours project. Some useful links are below:
