In [my original post on Wireguard](/posts/wireguard), I went through setting up the interfaces manually. This was good for learning how Wireguard works, but it gets annoying once you start adding more devices.

While researching on how to get Wireguard set up, I found (and probably everyone else will find as well) [this GitHub README by adrianmihalko](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/raspberrypiwireguard) explaining all the steps. It wasn't until later that I re-read it, specifically section #2:

> **2. Configuring WireGuard**
>
> We cover two way of setting up Wireguard and clients:
>
> - manually: that's what we do in this document
> - semi automatic mode via [WireGuard User Management Script](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/raspberrypiwireguard/wiki/User-management-with-Wireguard-User-Management-script)

That was the only mention of the user management script in the entire document, and it would have saved me a lot of time if I had seen it earlier. So, I went digging, and found that the project has [been forked a few times](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/wg_config/network/members), with very few of the changed being merged upstream. So, I thought, what's the harm in making one more.

# [s-thom/wg_config](https://github.com/s-thom/wg_config)

In this post I want to cover the basic usage, and what I learned about the script while making the modifications I wanted. That might sound a bit odd, because I'm meant to know everything about the script that I'm writing a post on my website about, but I came into this completely blind, not knowing how it worked, and wanting to adapt it to my needs.

## Dependencies

There are two dependencies for the script.

- Wireguard itself. Of course, the script won't do anythign if you don't have it installed
- `qrencode`. When generating users the script will output QR codes, so mobile device setup can be done faster.

## Basic usage

The purpose of the script is to add/remove peers from the interface. It doesn't do much beyond that. As such, it expects you to already have an interface running. If you haven't got one up already, I have some instructions in the **Server** section on [my other Wireguard post](/posts/wireguard).

Once you've `git clone`d the repository, there's some files to configure.

- `wg.def`  
   `wg.def` is the main configuration file for the script. It sets variables used by the script. I have a [table of the variables and their purpose](https://github.com/s-thom/wg_config#configuration) in the README of the script. A sample file is provided as `wg.def.sample`.
- `server.conf.tpl`  
   `server.conf.tpl` is the template for your server's Wireguard config. Any variables used in here will be replaced with their values in `wg.def`.
- `client.conf.tpl`  
   `client.conf.tpl` is like the above, but for each of the peers that get generated. One of the first modifications I did was to add the DNS entry into this file.

One important thing to note about the script is that it will only change the peers on an interface, nothing else. If you modify the `_OUTBOUND_INTERFACE` or other variables, no change to the interface will happen unless you `wg-quick down` and `wg-quick up` it.

Once you have the variables set in `wg.def`, addins a user is as simple as running a command:

```bash
sudo ./users.sh -a <peer-name>
```

The rest of the script is recorded in the README.

## Using the script on a pre-configured interface

If you're like me and only finding this script _after_ you've configured an interface manually, then finding out how to make it work without causing conflicts is a bit of a pain. Luckilly, I've gone through that, and know (a bit more about) what I'm doing.

### .available_ip

This file is generated the first time the script runs. I also added `./users.sh -g` to generate this file on the first run without affecting anything else. This command has no effect if the file already exists.

It contains a list of IPs suffixed with the network prefix length (e.g. `192.168.0.1/24`). When creating a new user, the first line of this file is used.

If you're coming from a pre-configured interface, run `./users.sh -g` and remove the lines for any already configured peers.

### .saved

`.saved` Is probably the most important file in the entire thing. When generating users, the script doesn't look at the interface to get the peers. It also doesn't scan the `users` directory to see what peers have been made before. Instead, all information about what peers are on the interface is in `.saved`. Each line looks something like: `<client-name> <client-ip>/<subnet-size> <client-public-key>`.

If you've got a pre-configured interface, you'll need to make a `.saved` file with one line for each peer.
